# sc_parser
## Solidity Smart Contract Parser
The purpose of this project is to be able to verify whether simple contracts have any security and logic flaws. This is to complement the coding process that is done in any text-editor by simply copy and pasting into the parser window. This parser does not check any syntax, but only checks for few most common issues known inside Solidity smart contracts.

## Getting started
For this project you will need:
```
1. Python 3
2. Flask
```
If you do not have Python 3 already, you will need the latest version that can be downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), or you can install it by using Homebrew.


#### Homebrew instalation
```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
#### Python installation using brew
```
$ brew install python3
```
#### Flask installation
